### CPSC 120
* Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because it was my first time learning about functions in C++.
Of course, we can write code without using functions, but we can write clean, easily readable code by using a function. Also, it was a good Lab where I could learn the basic form (ex. PromptForInt(start_month_prompt)) for function call.
