### CPSC 120

* Lab 3, part 2 was a favorite because it was my first time learning about functions in C++.
Of course, we can write code without using functions, but we can write clean, easily readable code by using a function. Also, it was a good Lab where I could learn the basic form (ex. PromptForInt(start_month_prompt)) for function call.

** Lab 4, part 2 was a favorite because this was the first lab session where the if-else statement came out. It was fascinating 
because I was able to create a hi-lo guessing game by using operators with if and else. Also, I learned that if-else is placed once again in the else statement of the if-else statement, and commands with complex conditions can also be executed.

** Lab 8, part 1 was a favorite because this was a lab session where I had to do complex coding using vectors. It was hard but nice lab session where I restrict repetition to vector.size() using a for statement and determine the value in that position using vector.at() using an if statement according to the conditions. Also, it was the first lab session that confirmed that the string was converted into double and stored using std::stod.
